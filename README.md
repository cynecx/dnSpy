Build instructions
==================

First grab the code using `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy.git
cd dnSpy
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Use Visual Studio 2010 or later or run `debugbuild.bat` / `releasebuild.bat`
to build it once you have all dependencies. You don't need Visual Studio
installed to run the `*.bat` files. The C# compiler is installed if you have
the .NET Framework installed.

You need the Visual Studio SDK to build ILSpy.AddIn. [NOTE: ILSpy.AddIn is
currently disabled in **Release** mode because the build server fails to build it
due to a missing dependency. You must enable it in VS: Build|Configuration Manager]

Dependencies
============

The `git` command above should've downloaded the correct versions. If you
can't use `git`, grab the code from these links. dnlib must have `THREAD_SAFE`
defined when you compile it.
